Redux: state management library that is used with react to manage your state. 

* It maintains the state of the entire application in a single immutable state tree which can't be charged directly. 
* There is a central store that holds the entire state of the application. Each component can access the stored state without having to send down props from one component to another 
* There are 3 building parts: actions, store, and reducers. 
* Redux is inspired by Facebook's flux and functional programming language elm.
