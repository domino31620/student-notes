<!--  The form element is around all of the text. It will not work if you do not have it wrap you entire form. 
* <form></form>
* <input> comes with many types. Usually is used with text. 
* Then an ID(which are sometimes used more in javascript). 
* Another attribute is name 
Label for tag is used to associate what the label is for.

Id is made to associate the tag with the processing script. Server needs the name to match. 

Putting in "tel" for input type will enable a phone number to be input into the form

There is an input type for emails

Fieldset is good way to break up your firm into manageable chunks. It helps to understand the form. 
* Not so overwhelming
* Legends are used to what this fieldset is doing. It describes the tag

Input can be used with a date tag.
* Fairly new so it may not be supported by some browsers
Input can have an attribute for minimum and maximum for numbers
 -->

 <!-- Notes 6/24

Radio buttons — suitable for a single choice among a few options. There should be at least two choices.
Attributes:
Name 
* always the same for ALL radio buttons in a group — identifies the choices for a single response
Value
* unique for each radio button — what is this choice?
Checked
* start the form with this value pre-selected
It's always good to back and click your radio buttons to make sure only one is clickable at a time. If more than one can be selected then you need to check your name attribute. 

You cannot have 2 name value attributes
